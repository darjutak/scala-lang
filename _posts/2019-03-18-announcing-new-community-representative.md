On the 6th of March 2019 the Scala Center Advisory Board welcomed Rob Norris as a new member, succeeding Lars Hupel in the Community Representative role, next to Bill Venners.

The Scala Center Team would like to sincerely thank Lars for his great work since the beginning of the Center, 3 years ago, writing and presenting community proposals (see: [SCP-011](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/011-debugging-symbols.md); [SCP-013](https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/013-sbt-migration.md)). 

We are also grateful that Rob accepted our invitation and wish him a great mandate ahead. Keep reading to find out more about the Community Representative role, how to get in touch, share your opinion or submit a proposal.


**Did you know?** The Scala Center’s Advisory Board is a forum for proposing and discussing initiatives which benefit the Scala open-source ecosystem or the Scala educational landscape. Each founding member, in consultation with the Scala Center, may propose initiatives for consideration. 
We expect the initiatives to cover a variety of different activities in the Scala community, including (but not limited to): 
- Development and maintenance of open-source Scala libraries 
- Producing documentation and learning materials 
- Developing tools and services of benefit to the Scala community as a whole 

**Did you know?** The community representative role is to be:

- Spokesperson for the Scala community at Advisory Board quarterly meetings 
- Gathering and expressing community’s opinion on certain topic related to Scala Center proposals
- Point of contact for community members/groups to review and help shaping community proposals
- Presents and defends community proposals at AB meetings

**Did you know?** The Scala Center turned 3 years old, check out our [first announcement](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2016/03/14/announcing-the-scala-center.html) back in 2016, or watch [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO8kDSJb-Gs) where Martin explains how the idea came about. We also recommend to watch Prof. Heather Miller’s [full talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeEAXpLp6Dc), to understand better how Scala Center fits in the wider effort of open source sustainable development.
